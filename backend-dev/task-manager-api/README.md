This Go task manager REST API follows industry best practices with a clean architecture that separates concerns and allows for easy extension. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### Project Structure

- **Clean Architecture**: Separated into domain, repository, service, and handler layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Components are wired together in the main function
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types with appropriate HTTP responses
- **Middleware**: Logging middleware for request tracking

### Technical Features

- **RESTful API**: Full CRUD operations for tasks
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Structured data storage with appropriate indexes
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles OS signals to shut down cleanly
- **Input Validation**: Request payload validation with appropriate error messages
- **Containerization**: Docker setup for local development
- **Modularity**: Well-defined interfaces allowing for different implementations

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `make docker-up` to start PostgreSQL
3. Run `make run` to start the API server
4. Access the API at http://localhost:8080

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/tasks` - List all tasks
- `POST /api/v1/tasks` - Create a new task
- `GET /api/v1/tasks/:id` - Get a specific task
- `PUT /api/v1/tasks/:id` - Update a task
- `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id` - Delete a task
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

This structure is designed to scale well as requirements grow. You can easily add new features by creating new domain models, repositories, services, and handlers without modifying existing code.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
